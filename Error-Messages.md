## Messages

### dereferenced expression is @Nullable

This error occurs when code reads a field, writes a field, or invokes a method on some expression, and that expression might be null.  Example:

```java
Object x = null;
x.toString(); // dereferencing x, which is null
```

To fix this error, you can move the dereference under a check that the expression is not null.  E.g.:

```java
Object x = null;
if (x != null) {
  x.toString();  // this is safe now
}
```

Be sure to add appropriate logic to handle the case where the expression is null!  Or, even better, try to find a way to rewrite the code so the expression can't be null in the first place.

### returning @Nullable expression from method with @NonNull return type

This error occurs when code is returning a `@Nullable` expression from a method whose return type is not annotated as `@Nullable`.  Example:

```java
Object m(@Nullable Object x) {
  return x; // oops!  return type is unannotated, hence @NonNull
}
```

To fix this error, you can add a `@Nullable` annotation to the return type, e.g.:

```java
@Nullable
Object m(@Nullable Object x) {
  return x; 
}
```

Or, you can place the `return` statement under an appropriate null check:

```java
Object m(@Nullable Object x) {
  if (x != null) {
    return x;
  } else {
    return new Object();
  }
  // this also works: return (x == null) ? new Object() : x;
}
```

### passing @Nullable parameter where @NonNull is required

This can happen in cases like the following:
```java
void nonNullParam(Object x) {}
void caller(@Nullable Object y) {
  nonNullParam(y); // bad!
}
```
To fix, either:
* Make sure `y` is non-null at the point `nonNullParam(y)` is called (e.g. by making the parameter to `caller` itself `@NonNull`, or adding an appropriate null check before `nonNullParam(y)` is called), **or**
* Make the parameter `@Nullable` in `nonNullParam`'s definition.

### assigning @Nullable expression to @NonNull field

Here's an example of how this can happen:
```java
class Foo {

  Object myField;  // @NonNull since it's not annotated

  void writeToField(@Nullable Object z) {
    this.myField = z; // bad!
  }
}
```

To fix, either make the right-hand side of the assignment `@NonNull`, place the assignment under an appropriate null check for the right-hand side, or make the field `@Nullable`.

### method returns @Nullable, but superclass method returns @NonNull

This error means you have overridden a superclass method in an invalid way.  Here's an example of why it's bad.

```java
class Super {
  Object getObj() { return new Object(); }
}
class Sub extends Super {
  @Override
  @Nullable 
  getObj() { return null; }
}
class Main {
  void caller() {
    Super x = new Sub();
    x.getObj().toString(); // NullPointerException!
  }
}
```

The key idea is that when code gets an object of type `Super`, it needs to be able to rely on the fact that `Super.getObj()` returns a `@NonNull` value.  If subclassing breaks this guarantee, it can lead to `NullPointerException`s.

### referenced method returns @Nullable, but functional interface method returns @NonNull

This is a version of the previous error specific to method references.  Example:
```java
interface NoArgFunc {
  Object apply();
}
class Test {
  static Object doApply(NoArgFunc f) {
    return f.apply();
  }
  @Nullable
  static Object returnNull() { return null; }
  static void test() {
    doApply(Test::returnNull).toString(); // NullPointerException!
  }
}
```
The key idea is that when code invokes `NoArgFunc.apply()`, it needs to be able to rely on the fact that the return value will be `@NonNull`.  If a method reference breaks this guarantee, it can lead to `NullPointerException`s.

### parameter is @NonNull, but parameter in superclass method is @Nullable

This error is similar to the previous one regarding bad overriding and return types.  Here's an example of why it's needed:
```java
class Super {
  void handleObj(@Nullable Object obj) { }
}
class Sub extends Super {
  @Override
  void handleObj(@NonNull Object obj) { 
    obj.toString(); 
  }
}
class Main {
  void caller() {
    Super x = new Sub();
    x.handleObj(null); // this will cause a NullPointerException
  }
}
```
Subclasses cannot safely override a method and annotate a parameter as `@NonNull` if the overridden method has a `@Nullable` parameter.

### parameter is @NonNull, but parameter in functional interface method is @Nullable

This is just like the previous error, but specific to lambdas and method references.  Example:
```java
interface NullableArgFunc {
  void apply(@Nullable Object o);
}
class Test {
  static void doApply(NullableArgFunc f, @Nullable Object p) {
    f.apply(p);
  }
  static void derefArg(Object q) {
    q.toString();
  }
  static void test() {
    doApply((Object x) -> { print(x.hashCode()); }, null); // NullPointerException
    doApply(Test::derefArg, null); // also NullPointerException
  }
}
```
Lambdas / method references cannot assume a parameter is `@NonNull` if the functional interface declares it as `@Nullable`.

Note that if the first `doApply` call were written as `doApply(x -> { print(x.hashCode()); }`, without the explicit type for the parameter, NullAway would treat the parameter as `@Nullable` (inherited from the functional interface method), and hence would report an error at the dereference `x.hashCode()`.

### unbound instance method reference cannot be used, as first parameter of functional interface method is @Nullable

This is the same as the previous error, specialized to the case of the first parameter of an unbound instance method reference (or a "Reference to an instance method of a arbitrary object supplied later"; see [here](http://baddotrobot.com/blog/2014/02/18/method-references-in-java8/)).  Example:

```java
interface NullableArgFunc<T> {
  void apply(@Nullable T o);
}
class Test {
  static <T> void doApply(NullableArgFunc<T> f, @Nullable T p) {
    f.apply(p);
  }
  void instMethod() {}
  static void test() {
    doApply(Test::instMethod, null); // NullPointerException
  }
}
```
Here, writing `Test::instMethod` is equivalent to writing `x -> { x.instMethod(); }`.  Hence, the `doApply` call will cause an NPE.

### initializer method does not guarantee @NonNull field is initialized / @NonNull field  not initialized

This error indicates that a `@NonNull` field may not be properly initialized in some case.  There are two ways to initialize a `@NonNull` field: (1) in the constructors of a class, or (2) in a designated initializer method.  For the case of constructors, each `@NonNull` field must be initialized in _every_ constructor (a constructor that invokes another constructor via `this(...)` is excluded).  A field can also be initialized in a method called by the constructor, provided that the method is either `private` or `final` (to prevent overriding) and the constructor invokes the method at the top-level, not under an `if` condition (to guarantee the call always executes).  NullAway only detects cases where a field is initialized via a direct call to another method from a constructor, not via a chain of calls.

An example:
```java
class C1 {
  // non-null fields
  Object f1, f2;

  // good constructor
  C1(Object f1) {
    this.f1 = f1;
    // initializing f2 in doInit() is ok, since it's a
    // private method and called at the top-level
    doInit();
  }

  private void doInit() {
    this.f2 = new Object();
  }

  // bad constructor
  C1(boolean flag) {
    if (flag) {      
      // bad: method called under a condition
      doInit();
    }
    // missing initialization of f1
  }
} 
```

Initialization can also occur in special initializer method to handle alternate initialization protocols, like Android lifecycles.  The checker has built-in knowledge of the following initialization methods:
```
  'android.view.View.onFinishInflate',
  'android.app.Service.onCreate',
  'android.app.Activity.onCreate',
  'android.app.Fragment.onCreate',
  'android.app.Application.onCreate',
  'javax.annotation.processing.Processor.init'
```
Overrides of these methods will be treated as initializers.  (If you think any third-party library methods should be added to the list, please file an issue.)  You can specify a method as an initializer with any `@Initializer` annotation, but this should be used very sparingly; it is best not to introduce one-off complex initialization patterns.  As with constructors, initializers can invoke private or final methods at the top level to perform initialization.

Note that for a field to be considered initializer by an initializer method, a non-null value must be assigned to that field over all possible paths through that method. The following code would not be considered to have initialized `foo`, as there is at least one case (due to the early return) where `foo` was not initialized.

```java
class C2 {
  // non-null fields
  Object foo;

  C2() { }

  @Initializer
  public int initMe() {
    if (!sanityCheck()) {
      return -1; // Error code.
    }
    this.foo = new Object();
    return 0
  }
}
```

If you get a field initialization error, you can fix it by ensuring the field is initialized in all cases, or by making the field `@Nullable`.

In addition to any annotation with the `@Initializer` simple name, Null Away recognizes as equivalent "initializer annotations" the following:

```
  'org.junit.Before'
  'org.junit.BeforeClass'
```

As well as any fully-qualified annotation name passed using the `-XepOpt:NullAway:CustomInitializerAnnotations=` configuration option.

### read of @NonNull field before initialization

This error is reported when a `@NonNull` field is used before it is
initialized, e.g.:
```java
class C {

  Object foo;
  
  C() {
    this.foo.toString(); // foo not initialized yet!
    this.foo = new Object();
  }
}
```

To fix this error, perform the initialization before reading the field.

### unboxing of a @Nullable value

This error is reported when some `@Nullable` expression gets [implicitly unboxed](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html) by some operation.  For example:

```java
Integer i1 = null;
int i2 = i1 + 3; // NullPointerException
```

These errors can be fixed in the same manner as the [dereferenced expression is @Nullable](#dereferenced-expression-is-nullable) error.

### Method is annotated with @EnsuresNonNull but fails to ensure the following fields are non-null at exit

This error is reported when a method is annotated with `@EnsuresNonNull` and a field mentioned in the annotation's parameters is not guaranteed to be `@NonNull` at all exit points.

Please see the example below where this error will be reported.

```java
class C {

  Object foo;
  
  @EnsuresNonNull("foo")
  C(boolean b) {
    if(b){
      foo = new Object();
    }
    // Here foo may still be null
  }
}
```

To fix this error, either make sure `foo` is initialized along all paths of the constructor at the exit point or remove the `@EnsuresNonNull` annotation.

### Expected field to be non-null at call site due to @RequiresNonNull annotation on invoked method

This error indicates that the called method is annotated with `@RequiresNonNull` and expects a certain class fields given in the `@RequiresNonNull` parameter to be `@NonNull` before the call.

Please see the example below where this error will be reported.

```java
class C {

  @Nullable Object foo;
  
  //this methods ensures class field "foo" to be non-null at exit point.
  @EnsuresNonNull("foo")
  void ensuresNonNullFoo() {
    foo = new Object();
  }

  //this methods requires class field "foo" to be non-null at call site.
  @RequiresNonNull("foo")
  String requiresFoo(){ 
    return foo.toString();
  }

  //class field "foo" is non-null at call site of "requiresFoo", hence no error will be reported.
  void test1(){ 
    foo = new Object();
    requiresFoo()
  }   

  //class field "foo" is non-null via call to "ensuresNonNullFoo" at call site of "requiresFoo", hence no error will be reported.
  void test2(){ 
    ensuresNonNullFoo()
    requiresFoo()
  }

  //class field "foo" is potentially null at call site of "requiresFoo", hence the above error will be reported.
  void test3(){
    requiresFoo()
  }
}
```

To fix this error, make sure the reported field is guaranteed to be non-null before the call.


### empty @RequiresNonNull/@EnsuresNonNull is the default precondition for every method, please remove it
Empty `@RequiresNonNull` and `@EnsuresNonNull` is the default type for all methods. Therefore we report an error on such cases to keep the code simple.

Please see the example below where this error will be reported.
```java
class C {

  Object foo;
  
  @EnsuresNonNull() //Here the following error will be reported since no class field is given in parameters
  void ensures(){

  }

  @RequiresNonNull() //Here the following error will be reported since no class field is given in parameters
  void requires(){

  }
}
```

To fix this error, smiply remove the empty `@RequiresNonNull` or `@EnsuresNonNull` annotation.


### currently @RequiresNonNull/@EnsuresNonNull supports only class fields of the method receiver: fieldName is not supported
This error indicates that the annotation parameter is violating the following syntax rule:
```
The annotation may only refer to fields of the receiver object.
```
Please see the example below where this error will be reported.
```java
class C {

  Object foo;
  C other;
  
  @EnsuresNonNull("other.foo") // error: can only be either "foo" or "this.foo"
  void ensures(){

  }

  @RequiresNonNull("other.foo") // error: can only be either "foo" or "this.foo"
  void requires(){

  }
}
```
While we are considering supporting such syntax in the future, right now NullAway isn't able to gain any information from such annotation. 
To reduce developer confusion we choose to report an error.

### for @RequiresNonNull/@EnsuresNonNull annotation, cannot find instance field in class
This error indicates that the annotation parameter is violating the following syntax rule:
```
All parameters given in the annotation must be one of the fields of the containing class or its super classes.
```
Please see the example below where this error will be reported.

```java
class Super {
  Object bar;
}

class C extends Super{

  Object foo;
  
  @EnsuresNonNull("foo") // no error: field is present in "C"
  void ensures(){
    foo = new Object();
  }

  @RequiresNonNull("bar") // no error: field is present in super class "Super"
  void requiresBar(){
    //not important
  }

  @RequiresNonNull("tmp") // error: field is not present in this class or any of it's super classes.
  void requiresTmp(){
    //not important
  }
}
```

### postcondition inheritance is violated, this method must guarantee that all fields written in the @EnsuresNonNull annotation of overridden method are @NonNull at exit point as well. Fields must explicitly appear as parameters at this method @EnsuresNonNull annotation

This error indicates that the annotation violates the following inheritance rule:
```
Every method must satisfy all postcondition of its super method.
```

Without this rule, a postcondition of `@EnsuresNonNull("field") void foo(...)` on type `Supertype` might be violated for `o.foo(...)` on `Supertype o = new Subtype()`,
depending on whether and how Subtype overrides the method `foo` of `Supertype`.

Please see the example below that demonstrates the necessity of this rule.

```java
class SuperType{
  Object foo;

  @EnsuresNonNull("foo")
  void ensures(){
    foo = new Object();
  }

  @RequiresNonNull("foo")
  String requires(){
    return o.toString();
  }
}

class Subtype extends Super{

  void ensures(){ }

  void error(){
    SuperType o = new Subtype();
    o.ensures();
    o.requires(); // call to requires potentialy leads to null pointer exception.
  }
}
```

Please see [link](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki/Error-Messages#method-returns-nullable-but-superclass-method-returns-nonnull) for more information regarding inheritance rules.

All overriding methods can only add new field names to the set of fields of its super method
mentioned in `EnsuresNonNull` and all should be mentioned explicitly in the annotation parameters.

Please see the example below where this error will be reported.
```java
class Super {
  Object bar;
  @EnsuresNonNull("bar")
  void ensures(){
    foo = new Object();
  }
}

class Child extends Super{

  Object foo;
  
  @EnsuresNonNull("foo") // error: method does not satisfy all its super methods post condition. "bar" must be also mentioned explicitly in the annotation parameter.
  void ensures(){
    foo = new Object();
  }
}
```

To fix this error, simply add `bar` as a parameter to `@EnsuresNonNull` annotation on `Child.ensures` method.

### precondition inheritance is violated, method in child class cannot have a stricter precondition than its closest overridden method, adding @requiresNonNull for fields makes this method precondition stricter
This error indicates that the annotation violating the following inheritance rule:
```
Every method cannot have a stricter precondition than its super method
```

Without this rule, a precondition of `@RequiresNonNull("field") void foo(...)` on type `Supertype` might be violated for `o.foo(...)` on `Supertype o = new Subtype()`,
depending on whether and how Subtype overrides the method `foo` of `Supertype`.

Please see the example below that demonstrates the necessity of this rule.

```java
class SuperType{
  @Nullable Object nullableFoo;
  @Nullable Object nullableBar;

  @RequiresNonNull("foo")
  String requires(){
    nullableBar = new Object();
    return nullableBar.toString() + nullableFoo.toString();
  }
}

class Subtype extends Super{

  @RequiresNonNull("foo", "bar")
  String requires(){
    return nullableBar.toString() + nullableFoo.toString();
  }

   void error(){
    SuperType o = new Subtype();
    o.nullableFoo = new Object();
    o.requires(); // call to requires potentialy leads to null pointer exception.
  }
}
```
Please see [link](https://github.com/uber/NullAway/wiki/Error-Messages#method-returns-nullable-but-superclass-method-returns-nonnull) for more information regarding inheritance rules.


No overriding methods can add new field names to the set of fields of its super method mentioned in `RequiresNonNull` annotation.

Please see the example below where this error will be reported.
```java
class Super {
  Object bar;

  @RequiresNonNull("bar")
  String Requires(){
    return bar.toString();
  }
}

class C extends Super{

  Object foo;
  
  @RequiresNonNull({"foo", "bar"}) // error: Having the preconidton of "foo" in addition to "bar" to be non-null at call site makes this method precondition stricter than it's super method.
  String Requires(){
    return bar.toString() + foo.toString();
  }

  // no-error: this method does not have a stricter precondition than its super method. It still requires "bar" to be non-null at call site.
  void Requires(){
    
  }
}
```

To fix this error, remove `foo` as a parameter to `@RequiresNonNull` annotation on the `C.Requires` method.
